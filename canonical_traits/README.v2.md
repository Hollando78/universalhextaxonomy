# UHT Trait Reference (v2.0)

This document provides the official reference for the **32 traits** used in the Universal Hex Taxonomy (UHT). These traits form the semantic backbone of UHT's 32-bit encoding system. Each trait represents a distinct, binary-identifiable property of an entity and is grouped into one of four conceptual layers: Physical, Functional, Abstract, and Social.

## üîÑ Trait Structure

Each UHT code consists of 32 bits, corresponding one-to-one with the following traits:

## ‚úÖ Usage Guidelines

* UHT encoding is **binary**: traits are either present (`1`) or absent (`0`).
* Apply traits **minimally and justifiably**‚Äîinclude only when essential.
* Use this trait list to **encode, decode, cluster, or compare** semantic fingerprints.
