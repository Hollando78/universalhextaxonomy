Based on our collaborative work refining UHT encodings for abstract concepts, here is an improved template designed for enhanced clarity and consistency. This version explicitly outlines the rules we've established, addresses past points of confusion, and provides a clear structure for a high-fidelity encoding.

The template encourages a rigorous, minimalist approach, focusing on the intrinsic, non-contextual traits of an entity.

### **Universal Hex Taxonomy Encoding Template**

**Entity:** `[Your Entity Name Here]`

**Instructions for Encoding:**

1.  **Apply all 32 UHT traits:** Systematically evaluate each of the 8 traits within each of the four layers (Physical, Functional, Abstract, Social).
2.  **Strict & Minimalist Approach:**
      * Include a trait **only if it is directly justified by the intrinsic, standalone nature of the entity itself.**
      * For **abstract entities**, remember to exclude physical traits that are only present in a representation (e.g., `Perceptible`, `Material form`), but include conceptual traits (e.g., `Communicative`, `Behavior-guiding`).
      * Avoid including traits based on metaphor, an entity's role within specific external systems or contexts, or secondary/derived uses.
3.  **Justification:** For each of the 32 traits, provide a brief justification for its inclusion or exclusion.

**UHT Code Generation Rules:**

  * The `uht_code` is a 8-character hexadecimal string, with each pair representing a layer.
  * For each layer (8 bits):
      * The trait defined as **Bit 1** corresponds to the **Most Significant Bit (MSB)** of the byte (position $2^7$).
      * **Bit 2** maps to $2^6$, and so on, until **Bit 8** maps to the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** of the byte ($2^0$).
      * Convert this 8-bit binary string (MSB to LSB) directly into a two-character hexadecimal pair.

**Output Format:**

Provide a `.json` object with the following structure. Fill in the `uht_code` only after completing your trait selections.
