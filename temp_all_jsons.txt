  "encoding_notes": "This encoding treats the 'Wedding Vow' as a social-abstract construct: an intentional, symbolic commitment shaped and maintained by cultural systems. No physical traits are included, and only those functional traits intrinsic to its communicative and purposive nature are selected. The encoding avoids trait inflation by not attributing structural, temporal, or autonomous properties unless they are integral to the vow's semantic identity. The exclusion of 'Part of a larger system' is debatable and flagged for possible revision in future harmonization passes."
