    "Physical object": "Excluded — The tenure system is a policy structure, not a tangible object.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Excluded — It is institutional, not materially fabricated.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — It is not derived from biological models.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Policies can evolve; tenure standards shift over time.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — It is not a material or physical structure.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — Its effects are visible, but the system itself is conceptual.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — It has no material embodiment.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — It functions through rules and decisions, not passive presence.",

    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Designed to ensure academic freedom and employment stability.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — It influences outcomes indirectly via roles and protections.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — It is not a signal system.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — It does not autonomously transform.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — It is not an interface or agent.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — Embedded within academic governance and institutional policy frameworks.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Relies on governance and enforcement to operate.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Important but not universally essential to the operation of an institution.",

    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Tenure symbolizes institutional trust and professional status.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — It is not inherently communicative, though it conveys status indirectly.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Excluded — While implemented via rules, this trait reflects internal logic processing.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Excluded — It is not internally modularized as a concept.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Included — Strongly shapes academic behaviors and career choices.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Included — The system reflects upon its own governance mechanisms.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Though time-bound in process (e.g., probationary periods), it is not intrinsically temporal.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Included — The system only exists within institutional and sociocultural context.",

    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — Defined and maintained through academic culture.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Institutions formally define its rules.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Included — It grants the role/status of 'tenured faculty'.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Included — Governed by policy documents, bylaws, and committees.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — Explained and handed down through policy, mentorship, and onboarding.",
    "Visible": "Included — Publicly recognized through announcements and directories.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — Varies dramatically by institution, discipline, and country.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Recognized across the academic world and often beyond."

  "encoding_notes": "The tenure system is modeled as a deeply social and abstract construct with strong behavioral and identity-signaling functions. Though not a communicative or logical processor itself, it operates symbolically, structurally, and within complex institutional systems. The corrected code '00848DFF' now faithfully reflects the selected traits."
