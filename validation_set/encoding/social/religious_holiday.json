  "encoding_notes": "This revision addresses prior conceptual underrepresentation by incorporating traits that are essential to the identity of a religious holiday. It now reflects its symbolic nature, temporality, and its embeddedness within larger religious systems. The corrected code '00848AFF' now faithfully matches the selected traits."
