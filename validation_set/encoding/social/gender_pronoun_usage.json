  "feedback": {
    "Physical object": "Excluded — Pronoun usage is a linguistic practice, not a tangible entity.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Excluded — It is a cultural-linguistic convention, not a fabricated object.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — While referring to biological identity, the usage itself is not biological.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Pronoun conventions evolve across time and cultures.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — It does not serve a structural role in the physical or architectural sense.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — Pronouns are perceptible in speech or text, but the usage convention is abstract.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — Pronoun usage is not inherently material.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — It plays an active role in social signaling and communication.",

    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Pronouns are intentionally selected in communication to reflect identity or context.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — While communicative, the usage does not produce output in the mechanistic sense.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — It does not compute or regulate signals.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — It can affect perceptions but not internal states directly.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — Pronouns are part of language, not interactive agents.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — Usage is embedded within grammatical, cultural, and institutional systems.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Pronoun meaning and usage rely on social interpretation.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Language functions without any one pronoun.",

    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Pronouns stand in symbolically for individuals.",
    "Communicative": "Included — They are a fundamental tool for interpersonal reference.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Excluded — Though grammar-based, their core identity is symbolic and social.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Excluded — Pronouns do not form modular or hierarchical systems.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Included — Their correct or incorrect use signals social alignment or offense.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — Usage does not inherently refer to itself.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Usage adapts over time but does not intrinsically reference time.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Included — Pronoun meaning shifts based on speaker, subject, and sociocultural frame.",

    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — Pronoun norms are built and enforced by social communities.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Grammar systems, institutions, and communities define proper use.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Included — Pronouns are directly tied to personal and gender identity.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Included — Institutions and style guides enforce pronoun usage rules.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — Taught through language education and socialization.",
    "Visible": "Included — Appears in written and spoken communication.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — Usage depends heavily on situation, culture, and audience.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Pronoun conventions are broadly understood and debated."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding treats gender pronoun usage as a symbolic, communicative, identity-signaling system deeply embedded in sociolinguistic conventions. It avoids conflating material traits with linguistic functions. The corrected code '0084C9FF' reflects its purposive, referential, and socially governed nature."
