    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Requires human initiation and performance.",

    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Officially codified by institutions such as national militaries.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Included — Reflects status, allegiance, and role within an organizational hierarchy.",

  "encoding_notes": "Revised to include symbolic and communicative functions intrinsic to the ritualized gesture. Exclusions strictly follow the non-object, non-autonomous, non-logical nature of the act. Represents a signal embedded in hierarchy and ceremony."
