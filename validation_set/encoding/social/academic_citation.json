  "encoding_notes": "The citation is treated here as an abstract-social artifact that functions symbolically and communicatively within the academic knowledge system. Its identity depends on institutional context, conventions, and referential purpose. The corrected code '0084C1FF' faithfully reflects its linked identity function and embedded social meaning."
