    "Physical object": "Excluded — A proof is a formal abstraction, not a tangible thing.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — Formal proof is an invention of mathematical logic.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Based on abstract reasoning, not biology.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Proofs are not fixed entities; they are composed and can be revised.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — Structure is logical, not material.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — Not inherently perceivable without representation.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — A proof exists independently of any physical medium.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Does not exhibit passive physical qualities.",
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Constructed to demonstrate or derive a logical conclusion.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — Does not autonomously produce effects.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — Encodes logic but does not process it.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — Has no internal state.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — Interpreted by humans, but not interactive itself.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Excluded — While used in systems (e.g., math), it is not a subsystem itself.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Requires an interpreter or context to operate.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Not inherently critical to any system operation.",
    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Proofs rely on symbolic language (e.g., logic notation).",
    "Communicative": "Included — Designed to convey formal truth or deduction.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Derivation strictly follows logical rules.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Included — Structured into premises, lemmas, and conclusions.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Included — Guides reasoning and deductive practices.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Included — Some proofs are about provability or logic itself.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Proofs follow a sequential logical progression.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Included — Meaning depends on formal system, axioms, and symbols used.",
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — The practice and validation of proof is socially defined.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Institutionalized in mathematics, philosophy, and CS.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not inherently tied to identity.",

    "Visible": "Included — Proofs are commonly represented visually or textually.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — Interpreted differently across logical systems.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Central to education, logic, and science."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding positions a logical proof as a fully abstract, intentional construct with formal structure and communicative purpose. It is symbolic, hierarchical, and deeply embedded in social and educational systems, but not a physical or functional actor on its own. The UHT code is identical to 'Concept of Zero' because both are fundamentally abstract tools with the same set of universal traits."
