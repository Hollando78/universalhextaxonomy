  "feedback": {
    "Physical object": "Excluded — Zero is a conceptual abstraction, not a tangible or physical object.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — Zero was invented and formalized by humans in multiple historical contexts.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — It has no biological basis or origin.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — It is a symbolic placeholder and not inherently fixed in form or function.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — It has no material or spatial structure.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — It is not inherently perceptible; it must be represented visually or symbolically.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — It is not composed of physical matter.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Not a passive entity in any material or functional sense.",
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Zero was created intentionally to solve numeric, positional, and representational problems.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — It does not generate any intrinsic output or effect.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — It is not an agent or system for processing anything.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — It has no state to transform.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — It is accessed through representation or language, not via direct interaction.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Excluded — While it is used in systems (e.g., mathematics), it is not itself modular or systemic.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — It does not act or operate independently.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — It is foundational but not functionally critical in any operational sense.",
    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Zero is a symbolic construct used to represent absence, quantity, and position.",
    "Communicative": "Included — Enables efficient numeric communication, especially in positional systems.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Zero is used in and defined by formal logic systems and arithmetic rules.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Included — Zero operates at various conceptual levels (e.g., positional value, null quantity).",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Included — The concept influences mathematical and computational reasoning.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Included — It can be referenced in terms of itself (e.g., 'zero of zero'), and has meta-conceptual uses.",
    "Temporal": "Included — It plays a role in representing time (e.g., zero point, starting state).",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Included — Its meaning varies by domain (e.g., null vs zero vs origin).",
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — Zero emerged through specific historical and cultural developments (e.g., India, Babylon, Mesoamerica).",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — It is standardized within mathematical systems and formal education.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Zero does not reflect social identity or personal roles.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — Its use is widespread and standardized, but not governed by legal or institutional regulation.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — It is universally taught and foundational in mathematics.",
    "Visible": "Included — It is rendered in symbols (e.g., 0) across notation systems.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — Its interpretation depends on domain and symbolic framework.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Zero is known and used across nearly all cultures and systems."
  },
  "encoding_notes": "This encoding captures the Concept of Zero as an intentional, symbolic, logical abstraction with cultural and pedagogical significance. It is not a functional agent but plays a critical representational role across disciplines. The code correctly places weight in the abstract and social layers, with minimal physical or functional attribution."
