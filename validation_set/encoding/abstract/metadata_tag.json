  "feedback": {
    "Physical object": "Excluded — A metadata tag is not a tangible entity; it exists as an abstract label or marker.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — Tags are human-defined conventions.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Not biologically modeled.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Tags can vary by context, application, or data.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — Logical structure only.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — Not inherently perceptible outside of representation.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — Exists in data structures, not physical materials.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — A tag itself doesn't exhibit passive physical behavior.",

    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Tags are created to classify, mark, or organize data intentionally.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — Does not generate output by itself.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — Does not perform processing.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — Tags are descriptors, not state machines.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — Accessed through systems, not inherently interactive.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Excluded — While used in systems, the tag itself is a unit of abstraction, not a subsystem.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Tags require context to function meaningfully.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Tags support metadata frameworks but are not critical individually.",

    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Tags symbolically reference categories or attributes.",
    "Communicative": "Included — Tags convey meaning about data.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Tags often follow naming rules, schemas, or ontologies.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Included — Tags may be part of structured vocabularies or hierarchies.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Included — Tags can guide system or user behavior (e.g., filtering, formatting, access).",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — While related to metadata, the tag itself is not self-referential.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Tags are not inherently time-based.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Included — Tags acquire meaning only within a given schema, system, or domain.",

    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — Metadata schemes and tagging vocabularies are socially negotiated.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Commonly established by institutions, platforms, or standards bodies.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Tags label data, not people.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — Rarely enforced legally, though schema adherence may be required.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — Standard tagging practices are teachable.",
    "Visible": "Included — Tags are visible to users, systems, or developers depending on access.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — The interpretation of a tag varies by system or domain.",
    "Widely known": "Included — The concept of tagging is pervasive across platforms and domains."
  },
  "encoding_notes": "A metadata tag is a symbolic abstraction used to structure and describe data. It is a communicative and behavior-guiding unit designed for context-dependent interpretation within data systems. Though essential to metadata infrastructure, it is not inherently physical or functional—it is an informational construct embedded in human-made logical and social frameworks."
