    "Physical object": "Included — A tangible mechanical device composed of gears, hands, and casing.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — Designed and constructed by humans.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Mechanisms are based on physics and engineering, not biology.",
    "Fixed/static": "Included — Generally stationary and not meant to be moved during operation.",
    "Structural": "Included — Its internal operation depends on precise physical structure (gears, springs, escapement).",
    "Perceptible": "Included — Meant to be seen and/or heard (e.g., ticking or chimes).",
    "Material form": "Included — Made from durable, manufactured materials (metal, glass, etc.).",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Actively moves through internal mechanical energy.",
    
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Designed to keep and display time.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Included — Shows time visually and sometimes audibly.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Included — Internal escapement mechanism regulates consistent time intervals.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Included — Winding modifies spring tension; mechanisms release energy over time.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — Users observe it but do not interact with it functionally.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — May synchronize or be integrated into broader timekeeping or architectural systems.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Requires periodic winding or external energy input.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Timekeeping is often helpful but not mission-critical in most settings.",
    
    "Symbolic / representational": "Excluded — Not inherently symbolic or abstract.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — Displays time but not in a communicative or coded way.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Internally operates on consistent, rule-based mechanical logic.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Excluded — Not composed of conceptual modules, only mechanical parts.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — It provides information but doesn’t prescribe behavior.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — Does not reflect on itself or represent abstract systems.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Core function is to represent and track time.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Excluded — Operates consistently regardless of symbolic or abstract context.",
    
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Excluded — Functionally universal, not constructed by cultural consensus.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Excluded — Exists across many systems but not semantically defined by any one.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not tied to personal or social roles.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — Some clocks are certified, but the concept isn’t intrinsically governed.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Excluded — Can be taught, but this is not central to its form.",
    "Visible": "Included — Deliberately designed to be viewed (often publicly).",
    "Context-sensitive": "Excluded — Displays absolute time, not contextually altered.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Clocks are globally recognized and ubiquitous."
  },
  "encoding_notes": "This encoding reflects the mechanical clock as a traditional timekeeping apparatus, emphasizing its engineered structure, functional logic, and universal recognizability. Abstract traits are limited to its time-based logic, while social traits are included only when visually and culturally universal. It excludes interaction and autonomy due to its passive user interface and reliance on manual winding."
