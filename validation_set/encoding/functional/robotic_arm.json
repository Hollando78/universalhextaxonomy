    "Physical object": "Included — A tangible mechanical device occupying space.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — Fully engineered and constructed by humans.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Included — Modeled after human or animal limb structures.",
    "Fixed/static": "Included — Anchored in a workspace or robotic base.",
    "Structural": "Included — Mechanical frame and joints are essential to its function.",
    "Perceptible": "Included — Visibly present, often with motion and sound during operation.",
    "Material form": "Included — Made of physical components like actuators, sensors, and joints.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Actively performs actions through powered control.",
    
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Designed to execute precise tasks.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Included — Moves, manipulates, or activates tools.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Included — Executes embedded or external control logic.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Included — Tracks joint angles, motion paths, and status.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Included — Especially in collaborative, surgical, or educational contexts.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — Often part of a manufacturing cell, lab setup, or robotic suite.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Included — Can execute preprogrammed tasks without live control.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Important but often modular or substitutable.",
    
    "Symbolic / representational": "Excluded — A functional tool, not a symbol or metaphor.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — Does not convey symbolic information unless explicitly programmed to.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Operates under programmed instructions and constraints.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Excluded — Physically modular but not abstractly structured for hierarchy.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — Executes behavior but does not guide it.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — Does not monitor itself conceptually.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Operates in time but not time-defined.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Excluded — Concrete tool, not a contextual abstraction.",
    
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Excluded — Functionally defined, not socially categorized.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Excluded — Specification-driven, but not semantically defined by a group.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not tied to social identity.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — Safety-regulated but not semantically governed.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Excluded — Can be taught about, but not a teaching artifact itself.",
    "Visible": "Included — Usually prominently placed and deliberately observable.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Excluded — Maintains identity across contexts.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Widely recognized as a component of robotics and automation."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding treats the robotic arm as a programmable, articulated mechanical agent within a functional and physical system. It is bio-inspired and interacts with humans in various domains but is not socially constructed or symbolically expressive. High representation in physical and functional layers reflects its engineered form and behavior."
