    "Physical object": "Included — A tangible hardware assembly within the car's engine system.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — Designed and manufactured entirely by humans.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Purely mechanical/electrical in design and function.",
    "Fixed/static": "Included — Installed in a permanent position within the vehicle.",
    "Structural": "Included — Composed of interconnected housing, switches, and wiring.",
    "Perceptible": "Included — User-facing interface elements such as key slot or start button.",
    "Material form": "Included — Constructed from metal, plastic, and electronic components.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Actively engages the ignition and control circuitry.",
    
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Built to initiate the engine's start sequence.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Included — Produces ignition spark and system activation signals.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Included — Especially in modern cars with anti-theft and diagnostics.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Included — Transitions the engine and vehicle systems from 'off' to 'on'.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Included — Requires human input (turn key, press button, detect key fob).",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — Functions within the broader vehicle electrical and mechanical system.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Requires a deliberate user action to initiate.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Critical for start, but bypassable with overrides in some systems.",
    
    "Symbolic / representational": "Excluded — Not a representational or metaphorical device.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — Interfaces with system but not designed to transmit symbolic messages.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Executes startup conditions and safety logic.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Excluded — Not abstractly modular beyond physical subcomponents.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — Does not guide behavior directly.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — No self-monitoring or conceptual tracking.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Functions instantly; not defined by time management.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Excluded — Role is consistent across vehicle contexts.",
    
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Excluded — Functionally standardized across cultures.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Excluded — Standardized by engineering, not semantically.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not associated with personal or social roles.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — Subject to safety standards, but not an intrinsic regulatory artifact.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Excluded — Commonly taught, but not inherently educative.",
    "Visible": "Included — Interface components are user-facing.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Excluded — Performs the same function regardless of environment.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Well-known component of nearly all vehicles."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding treats the ignition system as a functional component embedded in a car's architecture. It scores strongly in the physical and functional layers due to its material presence, human interaction, and purposeful activation of electrical processes. A single abstract trait is included for its logical role in validating startup conditions. Social traits are limited to public recognizability and physical visibility."
