    "Physical object": "Included — A tangible appliance commonly placed on kitchen counters or office stations.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — Fully designed and manufactured using human-made materials and components.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — No reference to biological systems or processes.",
    "Fixed/static": "Included — Typically remains in a fixed location while in use.",
    "Structural": "Included — Internal layout (water tank, heater, brew chamber) is essential to its operation.",
    "Perceptible": "Included — Features visible buttons, displays, and output of aroma, sound, and liquid.",
    "Material form": "Included — Constructed from durable plastics, metals, and glass.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Performs active operations like heating and pumping during brewing.",
    
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Designed specifically to produce brewed coffee.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Included — Delivers hot liquid (coffee) as functional output.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Included — Controls temperature, brewing cycle, and possibly programmable settings.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Included — Water is heated and transformed into brewed coffee; internal components track brewing stage.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Included — Operated via buttons or touchscreen; gives feedback via light, sound, or display.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Excluded — Typically functions independently, not networked or integrative.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Included — Can complete brewing cycles without human intervention after start.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Not essential to any broader infrastructure.",
    
    "Symbolic / representational": "Excluded — Its outputs and states are functional, not representational.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — Does not convey symbolic or coded information.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Brewing behavior follows defined internal logic and sequences.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Excluded — While componentized, it's not abstractly modular in behavior.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — May support routine, but doesn’t semantically guide behavior.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — No awareness or representation of its own function.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Brewing involves time tracking (preheat, brew, delay-start).",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Excluded — Function remains consistent across contexts.",
    
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Excluded — Common across many cultures without culturally determined semantics.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Excluded — Not defined or classified by social systems.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — No intrinsic link to social roles.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — May conform to standards, but not semantically governed.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Excluded — Can be taught to use, but not itself a teaching object.",
    "Visible": "Included — Displayed prominently; design aesthetics often emphasize visibility.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Excluded — Operates the same across environments.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Recognized globally in both domestic and commercial spaces."
  },
  "encoding_notes": "This encoding captures the coffee machine as a semi-autonomous, user-facing appliance with clearly structured physical and logical behavior. Its traits emphasize function, perceptibility, and ubiquity, while abstract and social characteristics remain minimal due to its utilitarian purpose."
