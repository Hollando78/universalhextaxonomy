    "Physical object": "Included — A dust particle is a tangible, bounded material entity that occupies space.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Excluded — Dust particles can be natural or artificial; synthetic origin is not intrinsic.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Most dust is inorganic; even biological dust (e.g. dander) isn't inherently biological in identity.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Dust is typically mobile and easily disturbed.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — A dust particle has no load-bearing or designed structural role.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — An individual dust particle is usually below visual threshold without amplification.",
    "Material form": "Included — It consists of solid matter and occupies a specific form in space.",
    "Passive": "Included — It has no agency and only responds to external forces (e.g., wind, electrostatics).",
    
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Excluded — It is not designed or purposed by default.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — It doesn’t generate outputs unless in context (e.g., pollutant); not intrinsic.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — It has no signaling or processing capability.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — No autonomous or inherent transformation occurs.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — Any interaction is incidental, not intrinsic to identity.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Excluded — May aggregate but not inherently systemic.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — No autonomy or function independent of environment.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Not essential to any defined system by nature.",
    
    "Symbolic / representational": "Excluded — Not used symbolically without imposed interpretation.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — Does not inherently transmit or encode information.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Excluded — Has no logic or structure governed by internal rules.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Excluded — Not composed of subsystems or organizational levels.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — Does not guide or constrain actions.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — Not capable of referencing or representing itself.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Exists in time, but temporality is not abstracted into its identity.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Excluded — It is a direct physical entity, not a conceptual construct.",
    
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Excluded — Its identity does not derive from social convention.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Excluded — Not framed by institutions or classifications by default.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not tied to roles, identities, or functions.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — No rules govern its behavior by design.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Excluded — Not a unit of knowledge or transferrable concept.",
    "Visible": "Excluded — Not typically visible as an individual entity without tools.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Excluded — Exists independently of specific contextual frames.",
    "Widely known": "Excluded — Dust as a category is known, but an individual particle is not culturally salient."
  },
  "encoding_notes": "This encoding describes a generic, isolated dust particle, not a symbolic aggregate like 'dust' in literature or 'pollution' in policy. Perceptibility and social traits are excluded due to scale and lack of cultural framing. Passive is now correctly included, as a dust particle exhibits no agency or internal behavior.",
