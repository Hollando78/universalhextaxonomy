  "feedback": {
    "Physical object": "Included — A quartz crystal is a tangible, spatially discrete physical object.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Excluded — Although sometimes synthesized, the default referent is a naturally occurring mineral.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Quartz is entirely inorganic; no biological basis or biomimicry.",
    "Fixed/static": "Included — It is rigid, does not change form on its own, and is spatially fixed.",
    "Structural": "Included — Has an internal crystalline structure defined by a regular atomic lattice.",
    "Perceptible": "Included — Clearly perceptible through sight and touch.",
    "Material form": "Included — Possesses a definite material form composed of silicon dioxide.",
    "Passive": "Included — Does not emit, act, or self-modify; it is passively present.",
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Excluded — It has no inherent purpose unless used by external agents.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — While it can generate signals in devices, this is not intrinsic to the material itself.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — It does not process information or signals by design.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — The object has no internal dynamics or state transformation under ordinary conditions.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — No direct interaction or responsiveness to human input.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Excluded — Quartz may be used in systems, but the entity alone is not system-bound.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Has no autonomy or inherent function.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Not critical on its own to the operation of any system.",
    "Symbolic / representational": "Excluded — Not inherently symbolic or representative.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — It conveys no messages or encoded communication.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Forms according to strict geometric and chemical rules; crystal symmetry is rule-based.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Excluded — Does not consist of modular or nested components.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — Does not influence or prescribe behavior.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — Does not refer to or describe its own logic or concept.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Quartz's vibrational regularity enables timekeeping; temporal property is essential in applied contexts.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Excluded — Its meaning does not flex based on context in a core material sense.",
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Excluded — Exists independently of cultural designation.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Excluded — Not defined by collective agreement or institutional designation.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not tied to any identity or role unless metaphorically assigned.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — No regulation governs quartz itself; usage may be regulated but not the object.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Excluded — Not a transmissible cultural or educational artifact in and of itself.",
    "Visible": "Included — It is plainly visible and often visually recognized.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Excluded — The object’s identity is stable across contexts.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Widely known and recognized across global populations."
