    "Physical object": "Included — Lava has tangible, spatially continuous material form.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Excluded — It is a naturally occurring geological event.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Not derived from or imitative of biological systems.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — It is dynamic and fluid by nature.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — It is not a load-bearing or support structure.",
    "Perceptible": "Included — Observable by sight, touch, and thermal sensors.",
    "Material form": "Included — Composed of molten rock, physically and chemically defined.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — It is an active, transformative physical process.",
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Excluded — Has no goal or design.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Included — Alters terrain, generates heat, and causes environmental changes.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — Not informational or computational.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Included — Cools and solidifies, transitioning material phase.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — It affects humans, but not interactively or responsively.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — A component of volcanic/geological cycles.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Included — Operates according to physical principles without intervention.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — While significant, it is not essential to Earth’s system functions.",
    "Symbolic / representational": "Excluded — May be metaphorically used, but not inherently symbolic.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — Does not convey or encode information.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Governed by deterministic physical laws.",

    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — Does not instruct or guide action.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — Not capable of modeling itself.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Occurs over time and has distinct beginning and end phases.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Excluded — Has consistent identity regardless of context.",
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Excluded — Exists independently of human culture.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Excluded — Not defined by institutional or cultural systems.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not associated with roles or identity.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — Not subject to governance.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — Commonly taught in earth sciences.",
    "Visible": "Included — Highly visible and often dramatic in appearance.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Excluded — Meaning and function remain consistent across contexts.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Well-known natural event worldwide."
