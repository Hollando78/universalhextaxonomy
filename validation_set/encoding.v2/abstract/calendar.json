    "Physical object": "Excluded — A calendar system is not a physical object; wall calendars and apps are its representations.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — Calendar systems are invented and maintained by human cultures.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — While inspired by astronomical cycles, their structure is synthetic.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Calendar systems evolve over time and differ by culture.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — Its structure is formal and conceptual, not architectural.",
    "Perceptible": "Included — Calendars are visually rendered to support their use.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — The concept of a calendar is not made of matter.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — It has no reactive or dynamic function in itself.",
    
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Created for coordinating events and structuring time.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — Does not autonomously generate results; output depends on interpretation.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — Encodes logic, but is not a processor.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — Its use does not involve internal transformation.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — The system itself is static; interaction is through media.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Excluded — Can be integrated but is not inherently part of another system.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Requires human use to function.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Helpful but not structurally essential to a system’s operation.",
    
    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Uses symbolic structures to represent temporal information.",
    "Communicative": "Included — Expresses dates, durations, and cycles to others.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Built on formalized leap-year rules, cycles, and sequences.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Included — Days form weeks, weeks form months, months form years.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Included — Used to guide planning, rituals, and deadlines.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — The system does not encode itself or refer to its own principles.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Its entire domain is the structure of time.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Included — Calendars differ by religion, culture, and purpose.",
    
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — Calendars are culturally maintained artifacts.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Institutionalized by religious or governmental bodies.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not specific to personal or group identity.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — While adopted officially, calendar logic is not formally enforced everywhere.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — Core knowledge taught in basic education worldwide.",
    "Visible": "Included — Always instantiated in a visible form for use.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — Varies across geopolitical and cultural contexts.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Universal across human societies."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding treats the calendar as a symbolic, logic-based, culturally constructed abstraction designed for temporal organization. It is not a physical object or a processor, but a framework used to coordinate and guide behavior within human systems. The uht_code reflects its highly abstract and socially embedded nature with minimal functional operation.",
