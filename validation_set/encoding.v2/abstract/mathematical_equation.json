  "feedback": {
    "Physical object": "Excluded — The equation itself is not a tangible object; it exists abstractly.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — The form and structure of equations are human-constructed symbolic conventions.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — There is no bio-mimicry or organic origin involved.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Equations may represent dynamic systems and are not inherently fixed in form or implication.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — Not a load-bearing or physically structural element.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — Visibility arises from rendering (e.g., on paper), not intrinsic to the equation itself.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — It is not composed of matter; it is a conceptual structure.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Not meaningfully applicable to abstract representations.",
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Equations are intentionally designed to express relationships and constraints.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — An equation itself does not generate a signal or effect outside of its interpretation.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — It represents logic, but does not act or process autonomously.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — Static by nature unless interpreted or manipulated externally.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Included — Created for and used by humans to convey or derive meaning.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — Exists within mathematical, scientific, or logical frameworks.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Requires external interpretation or manipulation to be active.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — While often important, it is not irreducibly essential to any one system.",
    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Its function is explicitly symbolic; it stands in for relationships or models.",
    "Communicative": "Included — Equations convey formal meaning via symbolic language.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Their validity and interpretation are strictly governed by mathematical rules.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Included — Equations can contain nested expressions and subcomponents (modular structure).",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — Not designed to guide behavior directly (like laws or instructions).",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — Some equations are, but this is not typical or essential.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Most equations are atemporal unless modeling time explicitly.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Included — Meaning may change based on symbolic context, domain assumptions, or notation system.",
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — The concept and notation of equations are created and maintained by cultures and disciplines.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Meaning and validity arise from being defined within formal systems (e.g., math, physics).",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not identity-bearing or role-specific in typical usage.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Included — Usage governed by syntactic and semantic rules of formal disciplines.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — Fundamental unit in mathematical and scientific education.",
    "Visible": "Included — Commonly represented in visual symbolic form.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — Interpretation depends on mathematical context (e.g., `x = y` in algebra vs. logic).",
    "Widely known": "Included — The idea of an equation is globally recognized and foundational."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding captures the equation as a symbolic, rule-based, communicative structure situated within formal systems and cultural transmission. It is not physical or agentive, but it plays a vital abstract and social role in human knowledge systems.",
