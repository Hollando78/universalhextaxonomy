    "Physical Object": "Included — A discrete, bounded specimen with solid form.",
    "Synthetic": "Excluded — Naturally formed without human intervention.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Included — Produced by biological organisms (coral polyps).",
    "Powered": "Excluded — No dependence on energy supply.",
    "Structural": "Included — Rigid, load-bearing structure contributing to reef formations.",
    "Observable": "Included — Visibly identifiable and perceptible to touch and sight.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Composed of solid matter (calcium carbonate).",
    "Active": "Excluded — It has no autonomous internal behavior or dynamic response.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Excluded — Naturally formed, not designed.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Excluded — Does not emit energy, signal, or force.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Excluded — No informational or logical operations.",
    "State-Transforming": "Excluded — Inert; no internal or functional change occurs.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Excluded — Not intrinsically designed for user interaction.",
    "System-integrated": "Excluded — A detached fragment, no longer part of a living reef system.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Excluded — Lacks autonomous behavior or internal control.",
    "System-Essential": "Excluded — Not a critical component of any active system.",
    
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — Not inherently a symbol, even if symbolically interpreted in culture.",
    "Signalling": "Excluded — Does not convey structured information or meaning on its own.",
    "Rule-governed": "Excluded — No abstract rules define its structure or use.",
    "Compositional": "Excluded — Not organized from modular subcomponents with distinct function.",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not guide behavior or enforce norms.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Not conceptually self-referential.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Has no time-based function or dependency.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — Entirely physical and real-world in substance.",
    
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Exists independently of social categorization.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Not defined by law, classification, or official status.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not tied to personal, group, or role identity.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — While coral trade may be regulated, the fragment itself is not intrinsically governed.",
    "Economically Significant": "Included — Has material value in trade, tourism, and ornamentation.",
    "Politicised": "Included — Involved in conservation policy, climate discourse, and marine territorial debates.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — May be used ceremonially, but this is a secondary cultural attribution.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Included — Its status as a harvested fragment implies ecological and conservation-related ethical concerns."
  },
  "encoding_notes": "Encoding reflects a coral reef fragment as a biological, material object with no symbolic or systemic function. Ethical and political significance are intrinsic to its detached status in the context of reef exploitation and global ecological awareness."
