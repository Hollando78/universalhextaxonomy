    "Physical Object": "Excluded — A lava flow is a dynamic, unbounded process, not a discrete or static object.",
    "Synthetic": "Excluded — Naturally occurring, not created or altered by human design.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — Has no biological origin or biomimetic design.",
    "Powered": "Excluded — It contains energy but is not powered by a designed input source.",
    "Structural": "Included — It reshapes terrain and can form structural features like solidified layers and landforms.",
    "Observable": "Included — Easily detected visually and thermally; observable by both humans and instruments.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Composed of physical matter, occupying space and made of molten rock.",
    "Active": "Excluded — It does not initiate behavior autonomously; changes result from external forces.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Excluded — It has no intentional structure or purpose.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Emits heat, light, and mechanical force; alters environments through direct effects.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Excluded — It does not interpret or transform informational content.",
    "State-Transforming": "Included — Undergoes phase changes, solidifies, and chemically alters as it flows.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Excluded — Any interaction is incidental or hazardous, not designed for human engagement.",
    "System-integrated": "Excluded — Not inherently part of an integrated system or network.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Excluded — Behavior results from physics, not internal logic or control.",
    "System-Essential": "Excluded — It is not a required component of a defined system.",
    
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — While culturally interpreted as symbolic, it is not inherently a symbol.",
    "Signalling": "Included — Its presence signals volcanic activity or environmental change, even without symbolic meaning.",
    "Rule-governed": "Excluded — Follows physical laws but no abstract or logical rules.",
    "Compositional": "Excluded — Not hierarchically modular or component-based.",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not direct or constrain behavior intrinsically.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Does not refer to itself or any abstract system.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Its identity as a flow is defined by time-based transformation and motion.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — Entirely physical, not abstracted or simulated.",
    
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Exists independently of social belief or consensus.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Not defined by institutional categories.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not tied to personal, group, or role-based identity.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — Not subject to laws or governance.",
    "Economically Significant": "Excluded — May affect economies, but is not economically defined.",
    "Politicised": "Excluded — Not intrinsically tied to political conflict or governance.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Ceremonial uses relate to interpretation, not the lava itself.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Included — Its impact on human life and ecosystems makes it ethically relevant."
  },
  "encoding_notes": "This encoding treats lava flow strictly as a physical geologic process — not as a symbolic, cultural, or mythic construct. Interpretive overlays (e.g., ritual, symbolism) are excluded as external attributions. Traits are selected based solely on the entity’s intrinsic properties and operation."
