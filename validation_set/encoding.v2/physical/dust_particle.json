    "Physical Object": "Included — A discrete, bounded speck of matter.",
    "Synthetic": "Excluded — Naturally occurring, not manufactured or shaped by human design.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Included — Dust often contains organic traces (e.g., skin cells, pollen).",
    "Powered": "Excluded — Does not rely on supplied energy to exist or function.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — Too small and fragile to bear loads or contribute to structural integrity.",
    "Observable": "Included — Detectable by visual observation (in aggregates) or instruments (microscopes, light scattering).",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Made of physical matter, occupying tangible space.",
    "Active": "Excluded — Has no internal mechanism or self-initiated change.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Excluded — Not created with intent; forms through natural disintegration.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Excluded — Does not emit energy, force, or signal in any intrinsic way.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Excluded — No capacity for interpretation or transformation of signals.",
    "State-Transforming": "Excluded — Inert at rest; does not alter internal state autonomously.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Excluded — Not meant to be interacted with intentionally.",
    "System-integrated": "Excluded — Exists independently; not embedded within a system.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Excluded — No internal logic or reactive behavior.",
    "System-Essential": "Excluded — Not essential to the identity or function of any defined system.",
    
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — Not intrinsically representative of concepts or identities.",
    "Signalling": "Excluded — Does not communicate structured or interpretive meaning.",
    "Rule-governed": "Excluded — No formal or logical structure applies.",
    "Compositional": "Excluded — Not composed of modular subcomponents with abstract significance.",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not direct or influence behavior.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Not reflective or self-referential.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Not defined by time-based change.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — Exists entirely in physical form.",
    
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Exists independently of social or cultural designation.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Not defined by any formal institution.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — No relation to social or personal identity.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — Not intrinsically governed by laws or policy.",
    "Economically Significant": "Excluded — Holds no intrinsic financial or trade value.",
    "Politicised": "Excluded — No direct relation to political structures or discourse.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not involved in any cultural or symbolic ritual practice.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Excluded — Does not present ethical concerns in its existence alone."
