    "Politicised": "Included — Central to national prestige, exploration policy, and international rivalry.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not part of symbolic or ceremonial practice.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Included — Raises critical planetary protection concerns on contamination, custody, and responsibility."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding isolates the Mars rock sample as a high-significance physical entity, separate from mission or data context. Its extraordinary economic, political, and ethical implications are intrinsic to its presence as a Martian material under Earth custody."
