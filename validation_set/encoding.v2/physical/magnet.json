    "Synthetic": "Included — Manufactured and magnetized by human processes.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — Not of biological origin or design.",
    "Powered": "Excluded — Does not require energy input; its field is a passive material property.",
    "Structural": "Included — Exerts stabilizing or positioning force on other objects.",
    "Observable": "Included — Perceptible directly or through magnetic detection.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Composed of physical matter.",
    "Active": "Excluded — Exhibits no autonomous behavior or internal transformation.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Included — Shaped and magnetized for functional uses across industries.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Emits a static magnetic field, causing observable influence.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Excluded — Does not interpret or transform signals.",
    "State-Transforming": "Excluded — Stable material; no internal state changes without external force.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Excluded — Not designed for direct interaction.",
    "System-integrated": "Excluded — May be used in systems, but not inherently embedded in one.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Excluded — No internal control or autonomy.",
    "System-Essential": "Excluded — Not indispensable to a defined system on its own.",
    
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — May be interpreted metaphorically but is not inherently symbolic.",

  "encoding_notes": "Encoding applies to a standalone magnet as a passive functional object, excluding roles in symbolic or system-based contexts. Economic significance is included due to material-critical status in global industry."
