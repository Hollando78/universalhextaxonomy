    "Physical Object": "Included — A bounded, solid manufactured item with physical dimensions.",
    "Synthetic": "Included — Produced through industrial fabrication.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — No design features draw from biology; layout is dictated by electronics constraints.",
    "Powered": "Included — Operates only when conducting electrical power.",
    "Structural": "Included — Supports components and physically integrates parts of a device.",
    "Observable": "Included — Inspectable via human or instrument-based visual means.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Composed of fiberglass, copper, and epoxy resin; material substance is core to its function.",
    "Active": "Excluded — Does not perform autonomous behaviors; routing is passive.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Included — Engineered layout for signal control and component integration.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Enables signals and power to reach destination components.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Included — Directs and shapes flow of logical and analog signals.",
    "State-Transforming": "Excluded — Does not change its own internal state.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Excluded — Not meant for direct use or interface by a person.",
    "System-integrated": "Included — Always serves as a component in a larger device or electrical system.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Excluded — Not independently functional.",
    "System-Essential": "Excluded — May be essential to a system, but that status is context-specific.",
    
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — Not used to represent anything beyond itself.",
    "Signalling": "Excluded — Enables signals but does not intrinsically communicate meaning.",
    "Rule-governed": "Excluded — Design follows physical constraints, not abstract logic.",
    "Compositional": "Included — Contains nested and modular structure (layers, traces, ground planes).",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not influence behavior or norms.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Not reflective or conceptual.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Not defined by time-based behavior.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — Entirely physical.",
    
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Exists regardless of human agreement or consensus.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Commonplace technology, not defined by legal or formal status.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not tied to identity or social role.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — May be subject to import/export controls, but not intrinsically regulated in form.",
    "Economically Significant": "Included — Core component of global electronics; critical to multiple industries.",
    "Politicised": "Excluded — Not inherently involved in political discourse.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not involved in formalized or symbolic ritual.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Included — Directly tied to environmental and labor issues across sourcing and disposal."

  "encoding_notes": "Encoding isolates the circuit board as a compositional, signal-routing object. It excludes symbolic or system-wide roles while recognizing the deep ethical and economic significance tied to its material production and global role."
