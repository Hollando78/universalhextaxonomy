    "Physical Object": "Included — A discrete, solid coil of wire with defined boundaries.",
    "Synthetic": "Included — Manufactured via industrial metallurgical processes.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — No biological origin or design inspiration.",
    "Powered": "Included — Designed to operate by having electric current passed through it.",
    "Structural": "Included — Its coiled form is designed to resist deformation at high temperatures.",
    "Observable": "Included — Visible as the light-emitting element within a larger assembly.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Composed of tangible tungsten metal.",
    "Active": "Included — Heats up and radiates light and thermal energy when powered.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Included — Engineered to produce light through incandescence.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Its primary function is to output light and heat.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Excluded — Does not interpret or manage data.",
    "State-Transforming": "Included — Transitions between a cold, inert state and a hot, glowing state.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Excluded — Not designed for direct human manipulation.",
    "System-integrated": "Included — Always functions as a core component within a larger system (e.g., a light bulb).",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Excluded — Entirely dependent on an external power source.",
    "System-Essential": "Included — The system (an incandescent bulb) cannot perform its function without it.",
    
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — Any symbolism is contextual, not intrinsic to the object.",
    "Signalling": "Excluded — Does not inherently encode or transmit structured information.",
    "Rule-governed": "Excluded — Obeys physical laws, not abstract or formal rules.",
    "Compositional": "Excluded — Not an abstract system composed of meaningful modules.",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not guide or constrain behavior.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Not self-referential.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Not defined by a time-based sequence or identity.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — A physical artifact.",
    
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Exists as a material object independent of social agreement.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Not defined by any formal institution.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not tied to social or personal identity.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — While its use in bulbs is regulated, the filament itself is not.",
    "Economically Significant": "Included — A key historical and industrial component in lighting technology.",
    "Politicised": "Included — Central to political debates and legislation regarding energy efficiency and the phase-out of incandescent technology.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not used in any formal cultural or ceremonial practice.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Included — Directly tied to ethical considerations of energy waste and environmental impact."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding captures the tungsten filament as a key technological component. It includes not only its physical and functional roles but also the intrinsic economic, political, and ethical significance arising from its use in a globally impactful technology. The UHT code was corrected to include the 'System-Essential' trait, resulting in final code DFB5000D."
