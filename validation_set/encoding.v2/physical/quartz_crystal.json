    "Physical Object": "Included — Discrete, bounded mineral specimen with tangible form.",
    "Synthetic": "Excluded — Naturally occurring, not man-made.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — No biological origin or design inspiration.",
    "Powered": "Excluded — Does not rely on supplied energy to operate. Piezoelectricity arises from mechanical input, not internal power.",
    "Structural": "Included — Its rigid crystal lattice contributes to its form and function.",
    "Observable": "Included — Easily seen and handled; perceptible to the senses.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Composed of silicon dioxide; a material object.",
    "Active": "Excluded — Does not initiate behavior internally.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Excluded — Naturally formed, not designed for a purpose.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Emits electric charge when stressed (piezoelectric property).",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Excluded — Does not interpret or manage signal flow.",
    "State-Transforming": "Excluded — Remains materially stable under normal conditions.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Excluded — Not designed to interface with humans.",
    "System-integrated": "Excluded — Exists as a standalone mineral, not part of a system.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Excluded — Does not perform actions or functions autonomously.",
    "System-Essential": "Excluded — Not essential to any engineered system unless externally embedded.",
    
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — Not inherently representational when treated as a mineral.",
    "Signalling": "Excluded — Does not communicate intentionally.",
    "Rule-governed": "Excluded — Not structured by logic or formal rules.",
    "Compositional": "Excluded — Not composed of modular subcomponents in the UHT sense.",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not guide or constrain behavior.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Does not refer to its own structure or role.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — No time-based structural identity.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — Entirely physical, not digital or virtual.",
    
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Exists independently of social agreement.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Not categorized or defined by any institution.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not tied to roles, personas, or social identity.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — Not subject to formal rules or legal governance.",
    "Economically Significant": "Excluded — Common quartz has low economic significance alone.",
    "Politicised": "Excluded — Not subject to political debate.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not used in formalized cultural or ceremonial behavior.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Excluded — No moral implications intrinsic to its existence."

  "encoding_notes": "This version treats quartz strictly as a natural mineral exhibiting piezoelectric output. 'Powered' is excluded, as the crystal itself does not depend on an energy source. No symbolic or spiritual interpretations are assumed."
