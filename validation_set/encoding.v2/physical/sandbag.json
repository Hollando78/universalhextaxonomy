    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — Not derived from biological sources or inspired by biology.",
    "Powered": "Excluded — Does not rely on an external energy supply.",
    "Structural": "Included — Used to create barriers or add physical weight for resistance or support.",
    "Observable": "Included — Clearly visible and tactile.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Made of physical matter (sand and bag) and occupies space.",
    "Active": "Excluded — Exhibits no self-initiated behavior or internal transformation.",

    "Outputs Effect": "Excluded — Does not emit energy or signal.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Excluded — No informational or logical function.",
    "State-Transforming": "Excluded — No built-in state change occurs during its use.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Included — Designed to be carried, placed, and adjusted by people.",
    "System-integrated": "Excluded — Can be used within systems (e.g., levees), but not inherently system-bound.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Excluded — Passive and requires human placement/use.",

    "Economically Significant": "Excluded — Holds minimal intrinsic economic value.",
    "Politicised": "Excluded — Contextual use may be political, but the object itself is not.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not used in formalized or traditional rituals.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Excluded — Does not carry intrinsic moral implications."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding considers the sandbag as a functional, passive, human-designed object. Abstract and social traits are excluded as non-intrinsic. Interaction is recognized as physical manipulation intentionally built into its use."
