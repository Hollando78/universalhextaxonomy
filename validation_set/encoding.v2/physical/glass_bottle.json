    "Powered": "Excluded — Inert and not dependent on energy input.",
    "Structural": "Included — Provides rigid containment and mechanical resistance.",
    "Observable": "Included — Visually and tactilely perceptible.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Composed of solid material (glass), with mass and volume.",

    "Intentionally Designed": "Included — Specifically formed to hold liquids, interface with closures, and enable pouring.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Excluded — Does not emit force, signal, or change.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Excluded — No signal-processing or computational behavior.",
    "State-Transforming": "Excluded — Remains static in form unless externally altered.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Included — Designed for human handling, opening, and usage.",

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding treats the glass bottle as a passive, manufactured container. Its physical and functional traits are clear, and its ethical relevance arises directly from its material lifecycle impact. All contextual uses or symbolic meanings are excluded."
