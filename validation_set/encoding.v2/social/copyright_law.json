  "feedback": {
    "Physical object": "Excluded — A law is an abstract construct with no inherent materiality.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Excluded — This trait is reserved for tangible, constructed entities.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — No relation to biology.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Laws evolve over time through amendments.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — The structure is conceptual, not physical.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — Perception occurs through its representations.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — The document is material, but the law is not.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Not relevant for non-material entities.",
    
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Excluded — While created intentionally, the law itself is not a functioning agent.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — Enforcement causes effects, not the law intrinsically.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — Law is referenced and interpreted, not autonomously processing anything.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — It does not possess a mutable state.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — It is intermediated through institutions or documents.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Excluded — Not a mechanistic subsystem.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — Requires agents for effect.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Fundamental to society, but not to a system in a functional engineering sense.",
    
    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Expresses abstract rights, duties, and principles.",
    "Communicative": "Included — Written and broadcast to inform behavior and expectations.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Defines structured conditions for permission, prohibition, and enforcement.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Included — Legal systems organize laws into articles, sections, and precedence structures.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Included — Explicitly intended to guide and constrain human action.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — A law does not inherently refer to itself.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — While it has temporal conditions (e.g. durations), that is not intrinsic to all laws.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Included — Applicability depends on jurisdiction, context, and interpretation.",
    
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — Law is an institutional norm system.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Formally defined by governments or courts.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Included — It governs authorship, ownership, and access.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Included — It is the codification of governance.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — A foundation of civic and legal education.",
    "Visible": "Included — Publicly documented and referenced.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — Application and enforcement vary by case and region.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Copyright is a well-known concept even among laypeople."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding captures Copyright Law as an abstract, symbolic, behavior-guiding system embedded in formal social regulation. It deliberately excludes all physical and functional traits, emphasizing law’s identity as a logical rule set that exists only through social consensus and institutional enforcement. The prior omission of hierarchical structure has been corrected to reflect legal modularity."
