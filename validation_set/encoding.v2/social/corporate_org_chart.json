  "feedback": {
    "Physical object": "Excluded — The org chart is typically a visual or digital abstraction, not a tangible object itself.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Excluded — While created by humans, it has no synthetic material form.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Its structure may echo biological hierarchies, but it is not biologically based.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Org charts evolve over time with company structure.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — It is not a physical structure but a conceptual one.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — Its depiction is perceptible, but the chart as a system is abstract.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — Exists in printed or digital forms, but not as intrinsic material entity.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — It plays an active role in communicating hierarchy and authority.",

    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Org charts are created to communicate organizational roles and authority.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Excluded — It does not independently generate effects.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Excluded — It is not a signal processor.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Excluded — It does not autonomously alter system states.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — It is a reference diagram, not an interface.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — It reflects the formal structure of a corporate or institutional system.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Excluded — It must be updated and maintained by people.",
    "System-critical": "Excluded — Useful but not foundational to the existence of the organization.",

    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Represents roles, reporting lines, and institutional hierarchy.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — While it conveys information, it is not itself a communicative agent.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Encodes relationships based on organizational rules and policies.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Included — It is a direct representation of hierarchical structure.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — It reflects roles rather than prescribes behavior.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — It does not describe itself or model model-making.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Though subject to change over time, it does not intrinsically express time.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Excluded — It is specific to organizational context but not abstracted across contexts.",

    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — Reflects social and cultural norms about organization and hierarchy.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Created and maintained by the institution it represents.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Included — Maps roles to people, embedding identity in structure.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Included — Conforms to HR policies and corporate governance standards.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — Used in training and orientation.",
    "Visible": "Included — Presented in public/internal documents, slide decks, and dashboards.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — Varies significantly across cultures and institutions.",
    "Widely known": "Included — The concept and format of org charts are broadly recognized across industries."

  "encoding_notes": "The corporate org chart is modeled here as a symbolic-abstract-social artifact that encodes organizational structure and roles. It is intentionally designed, embedded in institutional logic, and governed by formal rules. While visually represented, it is not a physical object, but rather a model of social architecture. The corrected code '0084B0FF' faithfully reflects the selected traits."
