    "Physical Object": "Included — A discrete, tangible device with form and housing.",
    "Synthetic": "Included — Manufactured using industrial processes and materials.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — While conceptually similar to homeostasis, the physical structure is not inspired by biology.",
    "Powered": "Included — Requires power (battery or mains) to operate sensors, logic, and display.",
    "Structural": "Included — Designed to maintain form and integrate sensors, logic, and user interface.",
    "Observable": "Included — Visibly displays current and target temperatures, system status, etc.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Composed of tangible materials such as plastic, metal, silicon.",
    "Active": "Included — Continuously monitors inputs and generates control actions.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Included — Purpose-built for environmental sensing and control.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Actuates HVAC or equivalent systems based on inputs.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Included — Evaluates temperature signals, control logic, thresholds.",
    "State-Transforming": "Included — Transitions between modes, states, and settings dynamically.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Included — Users adjust settings, schedules, and view system information.",
    "System-integrated": "Included — Always embedded in larger control infrastructure.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Included — Operates independently once configured.",
    "System-Essential": "Included — Essential to the functioning of automated temperature control systems.",
    
    "Signalling": "Included — Displays temperature, state, and control information to users; clearly communicative.",
    "Rule-governed": "Included — Operates via logic-based threshold rules and schedules.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Timers, delays, schedules, and temporal state shifts are intrinsic to operation.",
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — Not inherently representational.",
    "Compositional": "Excluded — Not abstractly modular.",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not prescribe behavior.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Not conceptually self-referential.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — Encoded here as a physical device.",
    
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Exists independently of social definition.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Not defined by formal institutions.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not associated with social or personal identity.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — May be subject to energy or housing regulations, but regulation is not intrinsic.",
    "Economically Significant": "Excluded — Functionally important, but not economically pivotal or contested.",
    "Politicised": "Excluded — Not directly involved in political discourse.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not used in symbolic or ceremonial practice.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Excluded — Mediates energy and comfort, but not ethically charged in itself."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding represents the thermostat as a rule-governed, signal-emitting, autonomous control device embedded in physical systems. While functionally and structurally rich, it is neither politically nor ethically contested in its intrinsic form. Code corrected to include the 'Active' trait. Final UHT code: DFFF6200."
