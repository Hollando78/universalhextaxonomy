    "Physical Object": "Excluded — The ignition system is a distributed set of components rather than a singular, bounded object.",
    "Synthetic": "Included — Engineered and assembled using industrial processes.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — No relationship to biological systems.",
    "Powered": "Included — Requires battery power to drive sensors, ignition coils, and ECUs.",
    "Structural": "Included — Embedded physically in the engine and dashboard architecture.",
    "Observable": "Excluded — Only visible through user interface elements, not as a unit.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Built from metal, wiring, and electronic modules.",
    "Active": "Included — Drives electrical and mechanical changes to initiate engine function.",

    "Intentionally Designed": "Included — Built specifically to control engine startup and input logic.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Triggers electrical and mechanical ignition events.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Included — Validates key/fob, handles timing and conditions.",
    "State-Transforming": "Included — Switches engine from off to active.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Included — Activated via key, button, or electronic trigger by the driver.",
    "System-integrated": "Included — Embedded within vehicle’s engine and control system.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Included — Operates automatically once triggered.",
    "System-Essential": "Included — Without it, the vehicle cannot start.",
    
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — Not inherently representational.",
    "Signalling": "Included — Communicates ignition status via dashboard lights, feedback tones, and security indicators.",
    "Rule-governed": "Included — Operates under deterministic timing and safety logic.",
    "Compositional": "Excluded — Not an abstract modular system.",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not prescribe behavior.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Does not self-represent or manage metadata.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Relies on timing for ignition spark and safety delays.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — A physical system.",
    
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Defined materially and functionally, not by social agreement.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Defined by engineering and design, not by classification alone.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not tied to identity or symbolic role.",
    "Regulated": "Included — Subject to formal emissions, anti-theft, and safety standards.",
    "Economically Significant": "Included — Critical to the function and value of all vehicles.",
    "Politicised": "Excluded — Not subject to ideological conflict or cultural controversy.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not involved in cultural or ceremonial behavior.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Included — Directly tied to safety, theft prevention, and emissions responsibility."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding defines the ignition system as a structurally embedded, functionally autonomous subsystem critical to vehicle operation. It communicates with users and is subject to regulation, reflecting its real-world complexity."
