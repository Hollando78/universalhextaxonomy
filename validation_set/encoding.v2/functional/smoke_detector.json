    "Physical object": "Included — A mounted, enclosed sensing unit occupying physical space.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — Fully engineered and mass-produced.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Detection based on photoelectric or ionization physics, not biology.",
    "Fixed/static": "Included — Installed on ceilings or walls for permanent operation.",
    "Structural": "Included — Internal chamber and layout affect sensing performance.",
    "Perceptible": "Included — Alarms are loud and visible, with obvious device presence.",
    "Material form": "Included — Plastic housing and embedded electronics.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Continuously monitors and emits alerts; not inert.",
    
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Built for the specific task of smoke detection and alert.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Included — Produces audible (and often visual) alarm signals.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Included — Uses logic to detect smoke density and decide threshold events.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Included — Tracks alarm states, test results, or battery conditions.",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — Has minimal interaction beyond alarm sound and test button.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — May be networked with other detectors or security systems.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Included — Operates continuously without manual input.",
    "System-critical": "Included — Essential for life safety in many regulated spaces.",
    
    "Symbolic / representational": "Excluded — Operates functionally, not as a symbol.",
    "Communicative": "Excluded — Communicates alerts but not through symbolic content.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Triggers alarm only when predefined thresholds are exceeded.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Excluded — Usually not semantically modular, though hardware may be.",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Excluded — May prompt action but does not prescribe behavior.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Excluded — No reflective logic or awareness of self.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Constant time-based sensing, with potential logging features.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Excluded — Operates independently of symbolic or social context.",
    
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Excluded — Function defined by physics, not social meaning.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Excluded — While manufactured to spec, not semantically group-defined.",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not identity-bearing.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Included — Subject to strict building codes and fire safety standards.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Excluded — Can be explained, but not designed for didactic use.",
    "Visible": "Included — Visibly present and designed for easy recognition.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Excluded — Operates the same across environments.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Universally recognized life safety device."
  },
  "encoding_notes": "This encoding reflects a smoke detector as a structurally fixed, perceptible, and autonomous safety device. It is defined by logical sensing and regulatory inclusion. Though not user-interactive or symbolic, its system-critical function and legal mandate justify inclusion of autonomy and governance traits.",
