    "Physical Object": "Included — A discrete and tangible mechanical housing with moving parts.",
    "Synthetic": "Included — Crafted by humans using industrial or artisanal methods.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — Not inspired by or derived from biological forms.",
    "Powered": "Included — Requires wound spring, gravity, or kinetic energy input.",
    "Structural": "Included — Rigid framework of gears, shafts, and supports.",
    "Observable": "Included — Movement and dial are perceptible to human senses.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Built from tangible materials (wood, brass, glass, etc.).",
    "Active": "Included — Moves autonomously while powered.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Included — Engineered specifically to keep and display time.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Emits structured output (time display, ticking, chimes).",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Included — Regulates motion via mechanical logic (escapement, ratios).",
    "State-Transforming": "Included — Advances its internal state in relation to time passage.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Included — Set, adjusted, and wound by human users.",
    "System-integrated": "Excluded — Typically self-contained, not embedded in larger functional networks.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Included — Runs independently once activated.",
    "System-Essential": "Excluded — Not required as a component within another system.",
    
    "Signalling": "Included — Communicates structured temporal information via dials or sound.",
    "Rule-governed": "Included — Operates under fixed, formal physical rules.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Identity and purpose are defined entirely by timekeeping.",
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — May have symbolic meaning contextually, but not intrinsically.",
    "Compositional": "Excluded — Not composed of abstract modular subunits.",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not prescribe behavior.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Not self-referential.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — Entirely physical and analog.",
    
    "Economically Significant": "Included — Historically foundational to industrial and maritime systems; still valuable in luxury and precision timekeeping markets.",
    "Politicised": "Excluded — Not involved in political discourse or regulation.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not part of ceremonial practice in its basic form.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Excluded — Not morally charged in production or use.",
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Exists as a physical object regardless of cultural framing.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Not defined by regulation or classification.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not inherently associated with roles or status.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — No intrinsic legal or institutional restrictions."
