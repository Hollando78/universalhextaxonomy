    "Physical Object": "Excluded — A node is not a discrete hardware artifact, but a logical software process instantiated on machines.",
    "Synthetic": "Included — Defined entirely by human-designed software and protocols.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — Not derived from or modeled on biological systems.",
    "Powered": "Included — Operates continuously on supplied electrical power.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — Has no rigid, bounded physical form.",
    "Observable": "Excluded — Invisible without instrumentation; lacks direct sensory presence.",
    "Physical Medium": "Excluded — Exists in digital memory, not as tangible matter.",
    "Active": "Included — Continuously verifies, transmits, and updates blockchain state.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Included — Built to execute consensus, validation, and networking functions.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Propagates validated transactions and blocks, shaping global ledger state.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Included — Performs cryptographic validation and executes strict protocol rules.",
    "State-Transforming": "Included — Modifies internal and network-visible state upon receipt of valid inputs.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Excluded — Not designed for direct sensory interaction.",
    "System-integrated": "Included — Meaningless outside the context of a larger blockchain network.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Included — Operates independently within peer-to-peer architectures.",
    "System-Essential": "Included — Fundamental unit without which the blockchain protocol cannot function.",
    
    "Signalling": "Included — Exchanges structured, protocol-defined data with other nodes.",
    "Rule-governed": "Included — Behavior strictly defined by consensus rules and validation criteria.",
    "Compositional": "Included — Composed of modular subsystems (e.g., networking, storage, logic engines).",
    "Meta": "Included — Maintains state about protocol version, sync status, block height, and more.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Operates with block timestamps, time-based coordination, and transaction expiry.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Included — Purely software-based and abstract; instantiated digitally.",
    
    "Economically Significant": "Included — Critical to the functioning of billion-dollar blockchain economies.",
    "Politicised": "Included — Embedded in ideological, legal, and regulatory battles over decentralization, anonymity, and trust.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Included — Tied to environmental impact, privacy, fraud, and algorithmic governance.",
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Rooted in technical protocol, not a symbolic or cultural agreement.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Exists prior to or independent of regulatory frameworks.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not inherently tied to personal or group identity.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — Regulation targets usage, not intrinsic function or form.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not used in symbolic or ceremonial contexts."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding captures the blockchain node as a functionally autonomous, digitally instantiated system component with essential economic and ethical relevance. It excludes physical traits to reflect its purely software-based nature. Final UHT code: 51F7770D."
