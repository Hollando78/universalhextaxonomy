    "Physical Object": "Included — A massive discrete structure with clearly defined boundaries.",
    "Synthetic": "Included — Manufactured and assembled through human industrial processes.",
    "Biological/Biomimetic": "Excluded — While some blades may be inspired by biology, biomimicry is not essential to the identity of a wind turbine.",
    "Powered": "Included — Requires electricity to operate yaw motors, blade pitch control, sensors, and control systems.",
    "Structural": "Included — Reinforced tower and nacelle architecture provide load-bearing support.",
    "Observable": "Included — Visually and aurally perceptible from long distances.",
    "Physical Medium": "Included — Composed of tangible materials like steel, carbon fiber, concrete.",
    "Active": "Included — Continuously rotates, tracks wind, and adjusts orientation or pitch.",
    
    "Intentionally Designed": "Included — Purpose-built to harvest wind energy and convert it into electricity.",
    "Outputs Effect": "Included — Produces electrical output with measurable external consequence.",
    "Processes Signals/Logic": "Included — Onboard systems process sensor data and control blade pitch, yaw, and braking.",
    "State-Transforming": "Included — Adjusts multiple internal and environmental-facing states in real-time.",
    "Human-Interactive": "Excluded — Operates autonomously with minimal direct manipulation.",
    "System-integrated": "Included — Deployed as part of a wind farm or energy grid.",
    "Functionally Autonomous": "Included — Manages its behavior and safety in changing wind conditions.",
    "System-Essential": "Excluded — Replaceable and modular; no single turbine is indispensable.",
    
    "Signalling": "Excluded — Does not communicate symbolic or informational content to humans.",
    "Rule-governed": "Included — Operates according to well-defined control logic and physical laws.",
    "Temporal": "Included — Function is fundamentally tied to time-based dynamics (wind patterns, cycles).",
    "Symbolic": "Excluded — May be symbolic in context, but not intrinsically.",
    "Compositional": "Excluded — Not abstractly modular in its encoded structure.",
    "Normative": "Excluded — Does not prescribe behavior.",
    "Meta": "Excluded — Not self-referential.",
    "Digital/Virtual": "Excluded — Encoded here as a physical energy system.",
    
    "Economically Significant": "Included — A core component of modern renewable infrastructure and capital investment.",
    "Politicised": "Included — Frequently debated in energy policy, land use, and climate discourse.",
    "Ethically Significant": "Included — Directly tied to climate ethics and environmental sustainability.",
    "Social Construct": "Excluded — Material object with intrinsic function.",
    "Institutionally Defined": "Excluded — Not defined by institutional fiat.",
    "Identity-Linked": "Excluded — Not inherently tied to individual or group identity.",
    "Regulated": "Excluded — Subject to policy constraints, but not intrinsically defined by them.",
    "Ritualised": "Excluded — Not used in ceremonial contexts."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding treats the wind turbine as an autonomous, powered, system-integrated energy technology. Biomimicry was excluded based on the minimalist standard, as it is not essential to the category. Final UHT code: DFF6220D."
