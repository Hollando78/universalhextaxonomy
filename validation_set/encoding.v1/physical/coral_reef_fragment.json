    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Included — Formed by biological processes from coral polyps.",
    "Fixed/static": "Included — Immobile and stable in form after breakage.",
    "Structural": "Included — Provides physical support in marine environments.",
    "Perceptible": "Included — Visually and physically obvious.",

    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Not used to signify identity.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Excluded — Laws may govern collection, but not object essence.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — Commonly studied in ecology and marine science.",
    "Visible": "Included — Visually striking and identifiable.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Excluded — Function and meaning remain stable.",
