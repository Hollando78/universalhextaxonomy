    "Physical object": "Excluded — An algorithm is a formal procedure, not a tangible object.",
    "Man-made / synthetic": "Included — It is an entirely human-designed construct.",
    "Biological or biologically-inspired": "Excluded — Most are based on mathematical principles, not biological models.",
    "Fixed/static": "Excluded — Algorithms are abstract and exist independently of a fixed instantiation.",
    "Structural": "Excluded — The structure is logical, not physical.",
    "Perceptible": "Excluded — Not directly observable outside of representation.",
    "Material form": "Excluded — It is abstract and not made of matter.",
    "Passive": "Excluded — Not applicable to a symbolic system.",
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — Created with the explicit goal of securing data.",
    "Emits output / produces effect": "Included — Produces encrypted or hashed output.",
    "Processes or regulates logic/signals": "Included — Executes logical transformations on input data.",
    "Transforms or modifies internal state": "Included — The algorithm's state changes in a predictable way in response to input and key, and it fundamentally transforms data (state).",
    "Interacts with humans directly": "Excluded — Interaction is mediated via interfaces or code; not intrinsic to the algorithm.",
    "Part of a larger system": "Included — A foundational component of secure systems and protocols.",
    "Autonomous in function": "Included — Once implemented, performs its function without human intervention.",
    "System-critical": "Included — In secure systems, failure of the algorithm breaks trust or functionality.",
    "Symbolic / representational": "Included — Uses formal symbolic rules to define transformations.",
    "Communicative": "Included — Enables secure communication by design.",
    "Logical / rule-based": "Included — Defined entirely by logical structure and deterministic operations.",
    "Hierarchical / modular": "Included — Many algorithms are composed of layered steps (e.g., rounds, key expansion).",
    "Behavior-guiding": "Included — Guides how systems and users structure secure data exchange.",
    "Self-referential / meta-conceptual": "Included — Algorithms often invoke themselves recursively or are designed using meta-principles.",
    "Temporal": "Excluded — Not inherently time-based, though execution occurs in time.",
    "Contextual abstraction": "Included — Behavior depends on key length, mode of operation, input format, etc.",
    "Socially / culturally constructed": "Included — Developed within academic, military, or corporate communities.",
    "Defined by a group/system": "Included — Standardized by institutions (e.g., NIST, IETF).",
    "Linked to identity or role": "Excluded — Does not define personal or group identity.",
    "Regulated / governed": "Included — Subject to export restrictions, compliance standards, and cryptographic regulations.",
    "Teachable / transmissible": "Included — Foundational part of education in computer science and cybersecurity.",
    "Visible": "Included — Often published in papers, RFCs, code libraries, and documentation.",
    "Context-sensitive": "Included — Implementation behavior depends on context of use.",
    "Widely known": "Included — Major algorithms are widely disseminated and scrutinized."

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding captures the Encryption Algorithm as a symbolic, logical, and socially governed construct with real functional significance. It is not a physical object but operates within highly structured technical and cultural frameworks. It is distinct from software *implementations* which would include more physical and functional traits.",
