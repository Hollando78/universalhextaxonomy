    "Passive": "Excluded — It has no reactivity or mechanistic behavior.",
    "Purposeful / intentional": "Included — National anthems are created deliberately to symbolize and represent nations.",

  "encoding_notes": "This encoding captures the National Anthem as a behavior-guiding, communicative, and symbolic cultural construct, embedded in formal and informal structures of identity and ceremony. The inclusion of both Contextual Abstraction and Context-sensitive is critical for capturing its shifting meanings and uses across diverse settings. It is not a physical or functional object, but rather a dense node of symbolic and social meaning."
